# First Week in Dragonereum

One week ago I [wrote](https://steemit.com/dragonereum/@hipster/dragonereum-why-you-will-want-at-least-one-dragon-51ac8af1fdc0fest) about Dragonereum. One week passed since the launch ... And I have some really exciting numbers to you.

## Some in-game results

1. More than 1/3 of [genesis EGGs](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfcad2859f3e602d4cfb9aca35465a618f9009f7b#balances) sold out.
2. [2400 DRAGONs](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfcad2859f3e602d4cfb9aca35465a618f9009f7b#balances) can live forever!
3. More than [250 addresses](https://etherscan.io/token/0x150b0b96933b75ce27af8b92441f8fb683bf9739) in the game
4. More than [7500 fights](https://etherscan.io/address/0x68ed06af5989e05bc4aa510b44dc6d003e225187) done! That is 3 fights per dragon or 30 (!) per address
5. [28k transactions](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/dapps/dragonereum). That is more than 100 per address.
6. Market for GOLD established. ~0.00005 ETH per GOLD gives us a cap of 3000 ETH or $300k. Markets of dragons, eggs, and breeding are also ready :-)
7. [CryptoAndGamers](QmYzUciGeMay2V8fVoQox9itmyYkfoQDAhPMGZCvmPmg4S.ipfs/#/marketplace/dragons/496) is the coolest dragon in the universe - DSI 82.48

Dragonereum is the biggest gas burner last week in the whole Ethereum network. I don't have exact numbers but using observations from [the gas station](https://ethgasstation.info/gasguzzlers.php) I bet one dragon that game burned 15% of the weekly gas supply. [This](https://etherscan.io/address/0xad3cdf38ccace151cdf5f03fa64c1518a75cf7af) and [this](https://etherscan.io/address/0x68ed06af5989e05bc4aa510b44dc6d003e225187)

Last week Dragonereum was a heartbeat of Ethereum! Amazing results Dragon Masters!


## Benchmark against Decentraland

I don't think that Decentraland is a competing project. Vice versa I am sure that Dragonereum and Decentraland complement each other. I believe that Dragons will be able to travel in Decentraland someday. But some numbers would be useful:

- Cap: Dragonereum is 1/500 of Decentraland
- Cap per core game unit: ~$2k in Decentraland vs $125 in Dragonereum
- Transactions: 63 (yep, sixty-three) in [Decentraland](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/dapps/decentraland) vs 28 thousand in Dragonereum. 500/1.

The main conclusion is that either Decentraland is highly overestimated or Dragonereum is underestimated or both.

## Benchmark against CryptKitties

Again I don't think that Cryptokities in any sense competing with Dragonereum. It is like comparing simple, primitive toy with a complex, complete game. Some guy at Arena told me that kitties are a good meal for Dragons, usually at breakfast.

- Transactions: 66k [Cryptokities](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/dapps/cryptokitties) vs 28k [Dragonereum](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/dapps/dragonereum)
- Active users: 2941 Cryptokities vs 392 Dragonereum
- Tx per active user: 22 vs 72

The main conclusion is that Dragonereum did not reach a scale of the user base of Cryptokities. But some numbers shows early signals that Dragonereum is more engaging.

## Atmosphere

1. Verified on [stateofdapps](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/rankings) and now 6th in global dapp rating
2. Verified on [dappradar](https://dappradar.com/dapps) and now 20th in global ethereum rank
3. The game is officially supported by 2 crypto browser vendors: [Cyb](http://cyb.ai) and [Buntoy](https://www.buntoy.com/).

Now we are sure that we have a huge room to grow and thank you, everybody, who is in THE GAME!
