Hi everyone! Today I intend to show you how to open web3 link with our web3 browser. If you have read our last [post](https://steemit.com/web3/@savetheales/gitcoin-lovers) you should have noticed IPFS hash at back matter. The thing is that we have web3 blog :)

First of all [download](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/releases) latest version of our Сyb and install it.

Next click on a Сyb icon. You can see something like this

This is the Root Registry by the way, but we will talk later about this. It is not so important, which page is opened, we need just to find search field at the top of the page. So, let's copy ipfs hash from previous [post](https://steemit.com/web3/@savetheales/gitcoin-lovers), paste it in a search field and attach `.ipfs` to the and of hash.

Alright! If everything is correct the following raw markdown file will be displayed. :)
As you see this is current [post](https://steemit.com/web3/@savetheales/gitcoin-lovers) which is broadcasting in ipfs and had signed by me ;)
