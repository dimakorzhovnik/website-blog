# Keystore management

## Key types

Key types can be conditionally divided into two groups: **agents** and **validators**.

**Agents** keys are used for linking content, sending liquid tokens, delegating, redelegating, and undelegating tokens to validators. Also, withdrawing rewards, voting and multisig accounts creating.

- `cyber` a.k.a. address. Cyberdcli application key.
  - Derived from account keys generated by `cyberdcli keys add`
  - e.g. `cyber15h6vd5f0wqps26zjlwrc6chah08ryu4hzzdwhc`

- `cyberpub` the public key of account address. Is used for generating multisig address.  
  - Derived from account keys generated by `cyberdcli keys add`
  - e.g. `cyberpub1zcjduc3q7fu03jnlu2xpl75s2nkt7krm6grh4cc5aqth73v0zwmea25wj2hsqhlqzm`

All agents user keypairs stored locally at `PATH_TO_CYBERD/cli/keys` folder. You can backup this folder for easy migrating between testnets or machines.

**Validators** are actors on the network committing new blocks by submitting their votes. It refers to the node itself, not a single person or a single account. Therefore, the public key here is referring to the node public key, not the public key of the agent address.

- `cybervaloper` validator application level address. It is associated with a public key `cybervalconspub`. This is the address used to identify your validator publicly. The private key associated with this address is used to delegate, unbond, claim rewards, and participate in governance. Generated by cyberdcli on application level. Application keys are associated with a public key prefixed by `cyberpub` and an address prefixed by cyberd network. Both are derived from account keys generated by cyberdcli keys add. 
  - e.g. `cybervaloper1carzvgq3e6y3z5kz5y6gxp3wpy3qdrv928vyah`

- `cybervalconspub` the public key of node/validator address. The private key associated with this Tendermint PubKey is used to sign prevotes and precommits.
  - Generated when the node is created
  - Get this value with `cyberdcli tendermint show-validator`
  - e.g. `cybervalconspub1zcjduepq0ms2738680y72v44tfyqm3c9ppduku8fs6sr73fx7m666sjztznqzp2emf`

> Note: A validator's operator key is directly tied to an application key, but uses reserved prefixes solely for this purpose: `cybervaloper` and `cybersvaloperpub`.

The node keypair stored in `node_key.json` and `priv_validator_key.json` at `PATH_TO_CYBERD/daemon/config` folder. You can delete it and restart docker if you want to change this keypair. The new pair will create automatically. Or you can backup it too and insert in the same folder at new testnet if you want same node pubkey.

## Generate keys

You'll need an account private and public key pair \(a.k.a. `sk, pk` respectively\) to be able to receive funds, send txs, bond tx, etc.

To generate a new _secp256k1_ key:

```bash
cyberdcli keys add <account_name>
```

Next, you will have to create a passphrase to protect the key on disk. The output of the above
command will contain a _seed phrase_. It is recommended to save the _seed phrase_ in a safe
place so that in case you forget the password, you could eventually regenerate the key from
the seed phrase with the following command:

```bash
cyberdcli keys add <account_name> --recover
```

Also, you can import your ETH account to `cyberdcli`:

```bash
cyberdcli keys add import_private <account_name>
```
by ETH private key

... and Cosmos account by seed phrase:

```bash
cyberdcli keys add <account_name> --recover 
```

cyberdcli provides compatibility of Cosmos and ETH public keys with Cyber addresses.

You can check your application account details by account name:

```bash
cyberdcli keys show <account_name>
```

You can see all your available keys by typing:

```bash
cyberdcli keys list
```

View the validator pubkey for your node by typing:

```bash
cyberdcli tendermint show-validator
```

Note that this is the Tendermint signing key, _not_ the operator key you will use in delegation transactions.

::: danger Warning
We strongly recommend _NOT_ using the same passphrase for multiple keys. The cyberd team and the cyberâ€¢Congress team will not be responsible for the loss of funds.

## Generate Multisig Public Keys

You can generate and print a multisig public key by typing:

```bash
cyberdcli keys add --multisig=name1,name2,name3[...] --multisig-threshold=K new_key_name
```

`K` is the minimum number of private keys that must have signed the
transactions that carry the public key's address as signer.

The `--multisig` flag must contain the name of public keys that will be combined into a
public key that will be generated and stored as `new_key_name` in the local database.
All names supplied through `--multisig` must already exist in the local database. Unless
the flag `--nosort` is set, the order in which the keys are supplied on the command line
does not matter, i.e. the following commands generate two identical keys:

```bash
cyberdcli keys add --multisig=foo,bar,baz --multisig-threshold=2 multisig_address
cyberdcli keys add --multisig=baz,foo,bar --multisig-threshold=2 multisig_address
```

Multisig addresses can also be generated on-the-fly and printed through the which command:

```bash
cyberdcli keys show --multisig-threshold K name1 name2 name3 [...]
```

For more information regarding how to generate, sign and broadcast transactions with a
multi signature account see [Multisig Guide](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd/blob/master/docs/multisig_guide.md).
