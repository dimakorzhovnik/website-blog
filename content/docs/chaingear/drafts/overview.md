# Overview

This project allows you to create your own Database of general purpose entries on Ethereum blockchain.
Entry type is defined during creation, so you can put into entry any custom logic you want (validation, entry-level permission control). Entries are tokenized as NFT.

Your creating your database in Chaingear - metadatabase, which are one point of access to all databases. Databases on chaingear level are tokenized as NFT. Chaingear is most expensive database, so you should pay for your database and entry creation.
